Building a Loan Prediction Model: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough

I recently completed a data science project to develop a model predicting loan approvals, using real-world data and key ML techniques. Here’s a breakdown of the process and insights gained:

Data Loading & Exploration:
   - Imported libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
   - Loaded the dataset, identified and visualized missing values, and reviewed key statistics to understand data distributions (e.g., applicant income, loan amounts, credit history).

Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling Missing Values: Replaced categorical NaNs (e.g., gender, marital status) with the mode and numerical NaNs (loan amount) with the mean.
   - Encoding Categorical Features: Converted categorical data (e.g., education, property area) into binary columns using one-hot encoding, which is essential for ML algorithms.

Target Variable Preparation:
   - Encoded loan status as a binary target variable (1 = approved, 0 = rejected) for a straightforward classification task.

Splitting Data for Training & Testing:
   - Separated features (X) and target (y), and split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets to evaluate performance on unseen data.

Model Training:
   - Trained a logistic regression model and handled a convergence warning by noting possible solutions (e.g., data scaling or increasing iterations).

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):
   - I applied SMOTE to generate synthetic samples for the minority class (loan rejections), creating a more balanced dataset without removing data from the majority class.
   - This technique allowed the model to learn from a wider range of patterns, especially those unique to loan rejections, improving recall for this group.

Class Weights in Logistic Regression:
   - By setting `class_weight='balanced'` in Logistic Regression, I adjusted the model to automatically give more importance to the minority class.
   - This ensured that the model didn’t favor loan approvals by default, improving its fairness and sensitivity to loan rejection cases.

Results:
   - With these techniques, the model reached an accuracy of 77.3% and an ROC-AUC score of 0.75, showing a marked improvement in its ability to identify loan rejections.
   - This approach effectively balanced the model’s recall across both classes, making predictions more reliable.

Key Takeaways:
   - Data quality is crucial: missing data handling and proper encoding led to a significant impact on model reliability.
   -Continuous evaluation: Real-world models require regular testing and tuning. The convergence warning suggests further tuning, like scaling or adjusting iterations.

   -Addressing class imbalance with SMOTE and class weights can be highly effective, especially for financial models where accuracy across all outcomes is crucial. This experience underscored the importance of handling imbalance thoughtfully for fair and precise predictive performance.

This project highlighted the importance of clear, methodical workflows in data science – from preprocessing to evaluation. Looking forward to applying these insights in future predictive modeling tasks!
